You can compare the menu changes against https://loadx.github.io/html5-wolfenstein3D/

_p.s If anyone at Bethesda or id software has objections to this being hosted on GitHub please let me know and I will remove it but I assume because it has been on GitHub since 2012, it's OK :)_

I was looking for a Blazor project when I found this. I did some minor tweaks to the menu and sound. I am not trying to be a game developer: If you are, check (https://unity.com/). 

I am considering using Blazor to make it online multi-player. There are a lot of decisions (PvP, dropsâ€¦) needed. Before any multi-player changes, I'll see how Blazor WASM compares to this javascript.
