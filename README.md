_p.s If anyone at Bethesda or id software has objections to this being hosted on github please let me know and I will remove it but I assume because it has been on GitHub since 2012, it's OK :)_

I was looking for a Blazor project when I found this. I am doing some minor tweaks to the html and javascript, then I'm going to move some (or all) of it to Blazor and make it online multi-player. Before making multi-player changes, I'll compare the javascript to Blazor performance.
